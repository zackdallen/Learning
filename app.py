print("""E pluribus unum (/ˈiː ˈplʊərɪbəs ˈjuːnəm/; Latin: [ˈeː ˈpluːrɪbʊs ˈuːnũː])—Latin for "Out of many, one"[1][2] 
(alternatively translated as "One out of many"[3] or "One from many")[4] — is a 13-letter traditional motto of the 
United States, appearing on the Great Seal along with Annuit cœptis (Latin for "he approves the undertaking [lit. 
'things undertaken']") and Novus ordo seclorum (Latin for "New order of the ages"), and adopted by an Act of Congress in
1782.[2] Never codified by law, E pluribus unum was considered a de facto motto of the United States[5] until 1956 when
the United States Congress passed an act (H. J. Resolution 396), adopting "In God We Trust" as the official motto.
